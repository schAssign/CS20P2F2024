1. Use a decision structure to write an appropriate statement for each of the following:

1a) 

if (grade >= 90) {
System.out.print("Great Job!");
}

1b)

if (number > 50 || number < 20) {
System.out.print("Error");
}

1c)

if (y < 100) {
y += 2;
}



2. Assume num1 and num2 contain integer values. Write an if-else if statement that displays one of the following messages as appropriate:

if (num1 > num2) {
System.out.print("First number is greater!");
} else if (num2 > num1) {
System.out.print("Second number is greater!");
} else {
System.out.print("The numbers are equal.");
}



3. Which is the appropriate word, odd or even for the blanks below?

3a. if even, else odd

3b.



4. Write statements that use Math.random() to generate random numbers for each of the following situations:

4a. (int)((50 - 1 + 1) * Math.random() + 1)

4b. (int)((100 - 20 + 1) * Math.random() + 20)

4c. (20 - 10 + 1) * Math.random() + 10



5. Identify the logic errors in the statements below, which should display a single appropriate message for any value of age:

The statements don't use >=, so anybody who is 18 won't have a message printed and anybody who is 65 won't have a message printed.
