1. Use a decision structure to write an appropriate statement for each of the following:

1a) 

if (grade >= 90) {
System.out.print("Great Job!");
}

1b)

if (number > 50 || number < 20) {
System.out.print("Error");
}

1c)

if (y < 100) {
y += 2;
}



2. Assume num1 and num2 contain integer values. Write an if-else if statement that displays one of the following messages as appropriate:

if (num1 > num2) {
	System.out.print("First number is greater!");
} else if (num2 > num1) {
	System.out.print("Second number is greater!");
} else {
	System.out.print("The numbers are equal.");
}



3. Which is the appropriate word, odd or even for the blanks below?

3a. if even, else odd

3b.
// In what world would you want to express this as a switch-case statement?
x = num % 2;
switch(x) {
	case 0: System.out.println("Even number"); break;
	default: System.out.println("Odd number"); break;
}



4. Write statements that use Math.random() to generate random numbers for each of the following situations:

4a. (int)((50 - 1 + 1) * Math.random() + 1)

4b. (int)((100 - 20 + 1) * Math.random() + 20)

4c. (20 - 10 + 1) * Math.random() + 10



5. Identify the logic errors in the statements below, which should display a single appropriate message for any value of age:

The statements don't use >=, so anybody who is 18 won't have a message printed and anybody who is 65 won't have a message printed.



6.

a) True
b) False
c) True
d) True
e) True
f) True
g) True



8. 

a) True
b) False. an if-else-if doesn't involve nesting. They can achieve the same ends if you try, though.
c) False. It must evaluate to an integer.
d) True.
e) False. When you generate a random number, it is a (double) by default, and you must cast it to an (int)
f) True
g) True
h) False. The order of operations is the other way around.
i) True
j) True
