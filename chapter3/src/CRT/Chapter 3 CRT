3a. What is the final value of "yourNumber" after the last statement executes?

4. Determine the appropriate data type for each of the following values:

4a. the number of basketballs in a department store.
-- int
4b. the price of a basketball.
-- int (don't use a floating point number for the cost of an item; use an integer and measure your prices in cents. floating point inaccuracy is annoying to deal with.)
4c. the number of players on a basketball team.
-- int
4d. the average age of the players on a basketball team.
-- double
4e. whether a basketball player has recieved a jersey or not.
-- boolean
4f. the first initial of a basketball player's first name.

5a. What is the difference between a primitive data type and an abstract data type?
-- A primitive data type stores a single piece of data. These are integers, boolean values, so on. In comparison, an abstract data type is something like a Class which contains methods for performing actions on data.
5b. What is the difference between a class and an object?
-- A class contains objects. Objects are variables within classes.
